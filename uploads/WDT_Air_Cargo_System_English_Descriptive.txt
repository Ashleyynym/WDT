Appendix D: User Permissions Description

Different user roles in the system have varying permissions:

- **Admin**: Has full access to all system functions. Can view and edit cargo, upload attachments, create bills, send emails, sign DO/POD, view archives, archive inspection/destruction records, modify cargo status, manage users, and manage templates and role information.

- **US Operations Staff**: Can view and edit cargo, upload attachments, create bills, send emails, view archives, archive inspection/destruction records, and modify cargo status.

- **Domestic Operations Staff**: Shares similar permissions with US Ops — able to view/edit cargo, upload attachments, create bills, send emails, view archives, archive inspection/destruction records, and modify cargo status.

- **Warehouse Staff**: Can view and edit cargo, upload attachments, sign DO/POD documents, and view archives.

- **Customs Brokers (record only)**: Can log inspection/destruction-related information but do not have broader system access.

- **Airline Representatives (record only)**: Can log inspection/destruction records but cannot perform actions on cargo or documents.

- **Inspection Centers (CES) (record only)**: Have permission only to log inspection/destruction records in the system.

- **Destruction Companies (record only)**: Like CES, they can only log related records and cannot modify or interact with other parts of the system.

Each role is designed to align with the operational responsibilities of its user group.
